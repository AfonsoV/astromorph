# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines the expectations for participants in this project.

## Guidelines

Software development in an open source community is expected to be a place for
sharing ideas and improve one another through helpful discussion and constructive
criticism.

**Everyone** is welcome to participate in this project and it is expected that all
involved will conduct themselves professionally (without resorting to violence,
discrimination and unwarranted sexual comments in all its possible forms).

If you are found to behave in a manner that is disrespectful to others, you are
expected to recognize your faults and change the problematic behavior. If you
fail to do so, you will be removed from participation in this project.

## Reporting issues

If you experience or witness behavior you deem not proper, please send a message
to the owner of this repository explaining your situation, including information
that allows for the identification (within github) of all involved.

If you feel that the current code of conduct is inappropriate, feel free to send
suggestions for improvement.
